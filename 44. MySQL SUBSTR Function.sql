# MySQL SUBSTR Function with Database Table:
-- Please use the following SQL Script to create and populate the Employee table with the required sample data.

CREATE DATABASE Company;

  Department VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  Salary FLOAT NOT NULL,
  Gender VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  Age INT NOT NULL,
  City VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL
);


SELECT DATABASE();
SHOW TABLES;
DESC Employee;


INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1001, 'John Doe', 'IT', 35000, 'Male', 25, 'London');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1002, 'Mary Smith', 'HR', 45000, 'Female', 27, 'London');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1003, 'James Brown', 'Finance', 50000, 'Male', 28, 'London');

SELECT * FROM Employee;


SELECT DATABASE();

# Now we will extract the sub-string from the name column starting from the third position up to 5 characters.

SELECT Id, Name, SUBSTR(Name, 3, 5) AS SubName, Department, City FROM Employee;


-- You can also achieve the above output by using the FROM clause as follows.

SELECT Id, Name, SUBSTR(Name FROM 3 FOR 5 ) AS SubName, Department, City FROM Employee;


# Now we will extract the sub-string from the name column starting from the third position to the remaining characters.
--  In this case, we donâ€™t require to pass the length parameter to the SUBSTR function

SELECT Id, Name, SUBSTR(Name, 3) AS SubName, Department, City FROM Employee;


-- You can also achieve the above output by using the FROM clause as follows.

SELECT Id, Name, SUBSTR(Name FROM 3) AS SubName, Department, City FROM Employee;
