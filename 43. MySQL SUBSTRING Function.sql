# Extracting a substring from a given string without the length parameter.
SELECT SUBSTRING('MySQL Tutorials', 3) AS SubString;		-- O/P 	SQL Tutorials


# Extracting a substring from a given string with the length parameter.
SELECT SUBSTRING('MySQL Tutorials', 3, 3) AS SubString;		-- O/P	SQL


# Extracting a substring from a given string when the starting position is negative. 
-- In this case, the SUBSTRING function will start from the end of the string and count backward.

SELECT SUBSTRING('MySQL Tutorials', -3)  AS SubString;		-- O/P	als


# Extracting a substring from a given string when the starting position is negative and also length parameter is provided.

SELECT SUBSTRING('MySQL Tutorials', -5, 3) AS SubString;		-- O/P	ria




# Substring Function Using FROM Clause
SELECT SUBSTRING('MySQL Tutorials' FROM 6);		-- O/P  Tutorials


SELECT SUBSTRING('MySQL Tutorials' FROM 1 FOR 5);		-- O/P	MySQL


SELECT SUBSTRING('DotNetTutorials.NET' FROM -3 FOR 3);		-- O/P	NET

# Now we will extract a substring from the name column starting from the third position up to 4 characters.

SELECT Id, Name, SUBSTRING(Name, 3, 4) As SubName, Department, City FROM Employee;


-- You can also achieve the above output by using the FROM clause as follows.

SELECT Id, Name, SUBSTRING(Name FROM 3 FOR 4) AS SubName, Department, City FROM Employee;


# Now we will extract a substring from the name column starting from the third position to the remaining characters. 
-- In this case, we donâ€™t require to pass the length parameter to the SUBSTRING function

SELECT Id, Name, SUBSTRING(Name, 3) AS SubName, Department, City FROM Employee;


-- You can also achieve the above output by using the FROM clause as follows.

SELECT Id, Name, SUBSTRING(Name FROM 3) AS SubName, Department, City FROM Employee;
